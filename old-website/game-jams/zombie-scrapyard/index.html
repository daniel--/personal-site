                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Zombie Scrapyard was created at TOJam 8 in 2013. The theme was uncooperative, this inspired us to make a co-op/competitive game in the style of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, where players are forced to work together to succeed but there is still only one winner. In Zombie Scrapyard you must work with your friends to collect the pieces to repair your car, but only the person who brings the last part can escape. Players have no defence against the zombies and must work together, only player luring the zombies away while the other collects the car parts.</p>

                <h2>Postmortem</h2>
                <p>While the gameplay is satisfactory there isn't much depth to it. The co-opertive vs. competitive element is interesting but the surrounding gameplay is fairly simple and not enough to maintain interest.</p>
                <p>The development of Zombie Scrapyard was difficult. It was the first time we used the Awesome Engine we developed for rapid prototyping at game jams and it was also the largest team we have had at a game jam. These two factors made development difficult but we managed to pull things together by the three day deadline. We had to learn how to use our own engine and add features to it on the fly. One of the more satisfying moments was late in development when we managed to make a three-fold increase in the frame rate.</p>
