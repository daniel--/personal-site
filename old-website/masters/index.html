                <h1>Masters Degree</h1>
                <p>I completed my Master of Science Degree from the University of Toronto in 2012. I was a member of the Computer Science <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/">Theory Group</a> and my advisors were <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/annual_report/toueg.htm">Sam Toueg</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Evassos/">Vassos Hadzilacos</a>. My reasearch was in Theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">Distributed Computing</a>.</p>

                <h2>Thesis</h2>
                <p>My thesis, titled A Pedagogical Presentation of the BG-Simulation, concerns the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Borowsky/TM-573.pdf">BG-Simulation</a>, an important result in theory of distributed computing. It shows that <i>f + 1</i> processors, <i>f</i> of which may fail can simulate a larger number of processors of which at most <i>f</i> will fail. The original presentation of the BG-Simulation was quite complex and difficult to understand. My thesis presents a new proof of the BG-Simulation designed specifically to be easily understood.</p>
